### Parent Influence on School and Reading

#### Academic Achievement in Middle School

Parental involvement in students' education is broadly associated with academic achievement throughout primary [@Galindo.2012; CITE TK] and secondary schooling (CITE TK). Over the past few decades, multiple meta-analyses have confirmed the value of parental involvement across multiple subjects and among students from various racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic backgrounds [CITE TK]. Parental involvement can take a variety of forms, including both home-based (e.g., TK examples) and school-based activities (e.g., TK examples). Parents can also be more indirectly involved in their adolescents' education by practicing academic socialization strategies such as discussing the value of education or encouraging students' education and career goals. Findings from a meta-analysis by @Hill.2009 suggest that during middle school, academic socialization strategies may be a particularly effective way for parents to provide educational support.

**TK should I move this paragraph to a section on academic socialization? shorten this (seems very long)?** In a meta-analysis that examined the relationship between parent involvement and academic achievement in middle school, @Hill.2009 found that academic socialization was more strongly associated with academic achievement than either home- or school-based involvement. The authors suggested that both the structure of middle schools and developmental changes during early adolescence may make academic socialization more effective than more direct home- and school-based practices. Compared with elementary schools, the organizational structure of middle schools is much more complex, with multiple teachers per student and each teacher serving many more students. This complexity limits opportunities for parents to develop partnerships with teachers and learn about the curriculum. Because academic socialization practices emphasize the value of education more broadly, this form of parental involvement may be less dependent on parents' interactions with teachers and knowledge of specific curricula. Academic socialization can also serve as a developmentally appropriate form of parent involvement. During the middle school years, adolescents typically seek greater autonomy as they begin to set goals and make decisions more independently (CITE TK). Academic socialization strategies, such as discussing or modeling the value of education, allow adolescents to exercise independence in daily school-related activities and decisions. Adolescents may not be as receptive to direct parent involvement at home or at school, which could interfere with their sense of autonomy.

#### Reading Achievement, Motivation, and Habits

**TK Add info about reading achievement outcomes!**

Parent involvement predicts reading achievement in kindergarten [@Galindo.2012].

There is considerable evidence that parents influence their children's reading motivation and habits [@Baker.1997; @Hume.2015; @Klauda.2009; @Lim.2015; @Pelletier.2024]. Parent influence children's reading habits and motivation by shaping the home environment, engaging in reading-related activities, and TK.
